# [SDF06] Project: Mobile App

## Project Overview

![alt text](<Mobile App.png>)

For this project I had to follow along the scrimba course at [Scrimba's mobile app course with Firebase](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript/lets-build-a-mobile-app-with-firebase-coafc415fb8e007eadfa60822).
Tasked with creating a shopping list web app, we were to utilise our knowledge of HTML, CSS, and most importantly Javascript, to build a stylish web app that could communicate with a database on firebase live in order
to add and delete items off of a user generated shopping list.

## Challenges Faced

Most of the Javascript came more easily this time around due to the exposure I am getting to it through these courses. That said, learning how to interact with firebase left me scratching my head at times learning the syntax.
It makes perfect sense, you just need to take the time to think about it and when you wrap your head around it, it clicks. I exercised CRUD practices of course, which was an experience I really enjoyed and I want to 
get further experience with backend tools after this project. All in all, the challenges were definitely learning how to use javascript to interface with firebase, but I am feeling confident at the end of this project and keen to 
exercise these new skills soon.

## Final Thoughts

This was a tricky but deeply educational project. I got the oppurtunity to work with firebase, a database tool provided by google that is particularly friendly to the front end developer.
Using firebase has lit an interest within me to familiarise myself with other back end technologies as I found it deeply rewarding to complete a project that touched on all facets of web development.
Learning how to utilise firebase within my Javascript to use "CRUD" principles on an online database was an experience that has taught me a lot, and as I said earlier, I am keen to use these skills soon.
